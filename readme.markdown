ColorbarPlot v0.6 (2010 July 10)
=================

ColorbarPlot is a function to plot a ContourPlot, DensityPlot or 3D plot with an attached colorbar to indicate the ranges of the function that is being plotted. The syntax is not exactly the same as for the built-in functions.

Warning! v0.4 and above is not backwards compatibile with versions 0.3 and below. Sorry.

The following functions are supported by ColorbarPlot:

- (List)ContourPlot
- List)DensityPlot
- (List)Plot3D
- ListPointPlot3D

An example file, ColorbarPlot-documentation.nb, is distributed with this package to demonstrate its use.

This package should work for Mathematica versions six and above.

To-do
-----

- Horizontal colourbar above or below the plot.
- Hybrid contour/density plot.
- More plot types? (Please suggest!)


Changes
-------

- v0.6 (TZ)  
More robust data and options handling. Extended the PlotRange option to be almost as powerful as the one of the built-in plot functions (there is still no difference between 'Full' and 'Automatic' for the z-range).

- v0.5 (MC)  
Added options for CTicksStyle and CLabelStyle to allow easy modification of the font styles in the colorbar ticks and label.  

- v0.4 (WR)  
PlotRange option is now supported for manually chosing the min/max scale of the colorbar.
List-based plots are supported.
CPadding option for adjusting the size of the colorbar.
Colors option replaced with ColorFunction option.

- v0.3 (MC)  
Added support for Plot3D; tidied up the code a little.

- v0.2 (WR)  
Inset used as a wrapper around the Row to add the colorbar to the plot so that the final output is a proper Graphics object. This allows MathPSfrag usage, for example.
